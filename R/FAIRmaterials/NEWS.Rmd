# File containing notes about version updates

# 0.0.2: The Beginning

*This is the very first build of FAIRmaterials. It will still require a lot of work before it is completely up and going, but for now this is a very good start. We have functions for FAIRifying: ftir, ivallreal, powerplant, QUV, and SunsVoc data. We look forward to the future where we have more functions with more uses!

# 0.1.0: The Next Update

*It's been a long time since the first installment of this package, but we came back an overhauled a lot of things here. Should have a lot of better features here.

# 0.4.0: Renaming and Shortening Output

We added functions for renaming data and for shortening the output of FAIRified files to only the user inputs.

# 0.4.2: Enhanced Ontology Tools in 'FAIRmaterials'

We're excited to announce a significant redesign in the 'FAIRmaterials' package! The updated tool now seamlessly translates ontological terms and corresponding data from CSV filesâ€”accessible via our new template [here][1]. The RDF triples generated are efficiently stored in OWL and JSON-LD formats, along with enhanced visualization capabilities. This update facilitates data accessibility, interoperability, and knowledge unification and ensures a simplified process for the creation of ontologies.
